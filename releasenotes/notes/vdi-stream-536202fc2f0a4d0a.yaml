    The os-xenapi library now supports the VDI streaming feature which will
    allow the library user to create XenServer VDI from a gzipped image data
    stream; or create gzipped image data stream from a specified XenServer
    VDI.

    By comparing to the existing dom0 glance plugin, the image data gets
    processed on the fly via streams. So it doesn't create intermediate files.
    And it completely uses the formal VDI import or export APIs when it
    exchanges VDI data with XenServer.
