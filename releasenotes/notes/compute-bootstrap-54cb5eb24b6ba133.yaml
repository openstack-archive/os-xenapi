    Now we can support boostrap an OpenStack compute node by running the command of
    ``xenapi_bootstrap`` from a VM which is running on XenServer. It will automatically
    finish the following bootstrap tasks:

    * configure HIMN interface (firstly need add a VIF for the VM to connect to HIMN.)

    * configure iptalbes to allow OpenStack traffic between compute VM and Dom0.

    * install OpenStack XAPI plugins into Dom0

    * gather XenAPI facts and save them into a json file which can be used
      as input for other OpenStack deployment tasks.

    * and other misc bootstrap operations: e.g. enable Linux bridge in Dom0.

    .. note::

           At the moment, ``xenapi_bootstrap`` only supports CentOS.
