    The os-xenapi library now supports the VDI streaming feature which will
    allow the libary user to create XenServer VDI from a gzipped image data
    stream; or create image data stream from a specified XenServer VDI.

    By comparing to the existing dom0 glance plugin, the image data is
    processed by using pipe steams. It won't create intermediate files and
    completely use the formal VDI import or export APIs.
